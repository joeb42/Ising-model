# Ising Model simulation

This is a simulation of the [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model) of magnetism. This models a magnetic material as an d dimensional lattice, where each lattice site is described by a discrete variable $\sigma$ known as the spin orientation. This repository is a numerical simulation of the Ising model, specifically implementing the [Metropolis-Hastings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model#Metropolis_algorithm) algorithm.
